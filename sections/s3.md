## S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

## Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number

## Amazon S3 Overview - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path:
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of **prefix** + **object name**
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)
- Object values are the content of the body:
  - Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
  - Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
  - Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## S3 Security

- **User based**
  - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- **Resource Based**
  - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
- **Note:** an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  - the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  - AND there’s no explicit DENY
- **Encryption:** encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  - Effect: Allow / Deny
   Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Bucket settings for Block Public Access

- Block all public access: On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLS): On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLS): On
  - Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies: On
  - Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies: On

- These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
- If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
- Can be set at the account level

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www
- The website URL will be:
- bucket-name.s3-website-AWS-region.amazonaws.com
  OR
- bucket-name.s3-website.AWS-region.amazonaws.com
- **If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!**

## S3 - Versioning

- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## S3 Access Logs

- For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
- Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket
- That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools…
- Very helpful to come down to the root cause of an issue, or audit usage, view suspicious patterns, etc…

## S3 Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable versioning in source and destination
- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
- Same Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- CRR - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
- SRR – Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

### S3 Durability and Availability

- Durability:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
  - Same for all storage classes
- Availability:
  - Measures how readily available a service is
  - Varies depending on storage class
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year

### S3 Standard General Purpose

- 99.99% Availability
- Used for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures

  - Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Glacier Vault Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed)
  - Helpful for compliance and data retention

## Shared Responsibility Model for S3

| AWS                                                                                                           | YOU                                                     |

## AWS Snow Family

- Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
- Data migration:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge
  - Snowmobile
- Edge computing:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge

### Data Migrations with AWS Snow Family

- **AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations** If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

- Challenges:
  - Limited connectivity
  - Limited bandwidth
  - High network cost
  - Shared bandwidth (can’t maximize the line)
  - Connection stability

### Time to Transfer

| Data   | 100 Mbps | 1Gbps    | 10Gbps   |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 10 TB  | 12 days  | 30 hours | 3 hours  |
| 100 TB | 124 days | 12 days  | 30 hours |
| 1 PB   | 3 years  | 124 days | 12 days  |

### Snowball Edge (for data transfers)

| Migration Size   | Up to 24 TB, online and offline | Up to petabytes, offline        | Up to exabytes, offline |

### Snow Family - Usage Process

1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you’re done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

## What is Edge Computing?

- Process data while it’s being created on an edge location
  - A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have
  - Limited / no internet access
  - Limited / no easy access to computing power
- We setup a **Snowball Edge / Snowcone** device to do edge computing
- Use cases of Edge Computing:
  - Preprocess data
  - Machine learning at the edge
  - Transcoding media streams
- Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)

## Snow Family - Edge Computing

- **Snowcone (smaller)**
  - 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access
  - USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
- **Snowball Edge – Compute Optimized**
  - 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
  - Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
  - 42 TB usable storage
- **Snowball Edge – Storage Optimized**
  - Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
  - Object storage clustering available
- All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
- Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

## AWS OpsHub

- Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
- Today, you can use **AWS OpsHub** (a software you install on your computer / laptop) to manage your Snow Family Device
  - Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
  - Transferring files
  - Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
  - Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
  - Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System (NFS))

## Hybrid Cloud for Storage

- AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
  - Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
  - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to
  - Long cloud migrations
  - Security requirements
  - Compliance requirements
  - IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premise?
- AWS Storage Gateway!

## AWS Storage Gateway

- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on- premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
  - File Gateway
  - Volume Gateway
  - Tape Gateway
- No need to know the types at the exam
