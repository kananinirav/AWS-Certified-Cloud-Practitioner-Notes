    - D. Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: A

    Explanation:
    - Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.).
    - Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
    - That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can
    simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

39. Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
    - A. Implement single points of failure.
    - B. Implement loose coupling.
    - C. Implement monolithic design.
    - D. Implement vertical scaling.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B

    Explanation:
    - Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.
    - The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.
    - This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.
    - So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

    - D. Enable Amazon CloudFront.
    - E. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: BE

    Explanation:
    - If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.
    - This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.
    - For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.
