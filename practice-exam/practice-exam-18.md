    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: D

    Explanation:
    - Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch.
    - For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider --and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly.
    - If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that).
    - AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size.
    - It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.
